![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I wanna sayn thank you to [Frontend Mentor] team for the opportunity that they gave us to improve our skills in Front-End development by providing challenges that make us encouraged to do more and more.

## First challenge

The first challenge as you can see is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible, So I did my best to make it like the real one.

So this is a simple project that whiche shows how to do the following:

* Creat a responsive web page.
* Control the size of images and fonts
* Get the font libraries
* How to match colors
